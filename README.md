# pyvm
Python Virtual Manager for Installing, Configuring, Updating, Deleting any official python versions and other flavors. This package takes away all the manual work required to switch between python versions at system level. Also, this package comes with the in-built support to work with virtualenv, so you can easily create project level virtual environments. Performing security audits, updating the dependencies safely, knowing the impact of a dependency change will also be covered as part of this project's core functionality. We will also have plugin functionality to enable you to customise it further.
